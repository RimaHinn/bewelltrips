What Do You Do At a Wellness Retreat?
As we said, there are wellness retreats for nearly any interest, need, and desire. So what can you expect in a retreat?

Healthy eating: Some retreats tout body composition scans and highly analytical methods to determine your ideal diet, while others simply focus on providing healthy meals using locally sourced ingredients. It’s especially important to do due diligence before choosing a wellness retreat in this category. Beware the retreat that promises magic weight loss solutions or methods not founded in proven medical research.
Physical fitness: Some retreats and resorts will develop full training regimens to help you build stamina and strength. But physical fitness isn’t just about working out. Others focus on sleep therapy, bone and joint health, and general mobility, for example.
Yoga: There’s so much variety even within this category — couples’ yoga, meditative yoga, intensive training for experienced yogis — you might have trouble choosing.
Time in nature: As we note below, spending time outdoors can be extremely restorative mentally and physically. Retreats that help connect us with nature may do so by organizing nature walks or hiking, foraging expeditions, surfing lessons, fishing trips, even paragliding.
Meditation and spiritual practice: Mindfulness or deepening a connection to a higher being can help us heal and become better versions of our present selves. Doing this on our own is difficult, so wellness retreats often pair us with professionals who can guide us and the restful environments we need to get the most out of our practice.
Special interest: When your wellness journey is more about learning something new just for the sake of gaining knowledge or growing a hobby, there are plenty of retreats that cater to specific interests. You’ll find a reading retreat for book lovers below, but there are also opportunities to practice organic cooking, pottery and painting, sailing … the list goes on.
